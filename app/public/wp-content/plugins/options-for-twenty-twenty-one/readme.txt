The Twenty Twenty-One theme does not use jQuery, we use pure JavaScript on the front end of this plugin so it doesn't need to enqueue jQuery.

This plugin makes use of hooks instead of child themes or custom templates which means it will work even after new versions of Twenty Twenty-One are published by the theme developers without breaking the theme :)

== Installation ==

1) Install "Options for Twenty Twenty-One" automatically or by uploading the ZIP file.
